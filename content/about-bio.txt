Create a modern, clean, and welcoming multi-page website for a non-profit organization named "QIDMA". The design should be professional and trustworthy, primarily using a color palette of green and blue to evoke a sense of community, growth, and reliability.

Global Elements:

Header: A clean navigation bar at the top with the QIDMA logo (placeholder) on the left and links to the following pages: About, Board, Events, Gallery, Donate, and Contact. The "Donate" button should be styled as a primary call-to-action (e.g., with a solid background color).

Footer: A simple footer with the organization's contact info (Email, Google Voice, Instagram link), quick links to key pages, and a copyright notice.

Homepage:

Hero Section: A full-width banner image featuring a diverse group of community members or volunteers. Overlay text with the main heading "QIDMA" and the subheading "Serving with Purpose". Include two buttons: "Donate Now" and "Learn More".

About Us Summary: A section with a brief introduction using the first paragraph of the bio: "QIDMA is a grassroots nonprofit organization... committed to building a more inclusive and empowered Franklin." Include a "Read Our Story" button that links to the full About page.

Upcoming Events Preview: A small, card-based section showcasing 2-3 upcoming events with the event title, date, and a "View Details" link for each, all linking to the main Events Page.

Newsletter Signup: A simple, inviting section with a heading like "Stay Connected" and a form with a single field for an email address and a "Subscribe" button.

Call to Action: A prominent section encouraging donations, with a brief, impactful statement and a clear "Support Our Mission" button linking to the Donation page.

Page 1: About Us

This page should feature the full "About/Bio of Organization" text provided, starting with "Serving with Purpose".

Below the bio, create a "Meet Our Board" section. Display the board members in a grid or row format. Each entry should include a placeholder for a headshot, their name, and their title.

A dedicated page to list all upcoming and past events.

Use a clean list or calendar layout. Each event entry should have a title, date, time, a short description, and location.

Create distinct sections or cards for donation methods:

Include a clearly visible field or text area for the organization's Tax ID for donors.

End with a heartfelt "Thank you for your generosity!" message.
